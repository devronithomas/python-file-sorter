# Python program for sorting files

I created this program as an experiment to play with Python. I would gladly accept pointers from others to improve, simplify, or make the code more efficient. If you would like to make any comments then please feel free to email me at dev.ronithomas@gmail.com.

### Used Library:
```python
import os
import shutil
```

### Included file types
```python
#file types
docs = (".docx", ".doc", ".pdf", ".txt")
img = (".png", ".jpeg", ".jpg")
prg = (".exe", ".msi")
comprs = (".zip", ".rar")
aud = (".mp3", ".wav")
vid = (".mp4", ".mov", ".avi")
```
Please edit the code to add more file types.

### Advantages
>1. Creates only required folder
>2. Fast processing 
>3. Easy to understand and debug
